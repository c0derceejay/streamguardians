# Streaming Moderators Website

## Overview
This project aims to create a website where streaming moderators can create profiles, and streamers can search, view, and communicate with potential moderators. Below is a high-level approach to building this website.

## 1. User Profiles

### User Registration and Login
- Implement authentication systems like OAuth or a custom email/password system.

### Profile Creation
- Allow moderators to create detailed profiles with fields such as:
  - Username
  - Contact information
  - Links to social media

### Platform Selection
- Provide options to select the streaming platforms they moderate on or wish to moderate on (e.g., Twitch, YouTube, etc.).

### Profile Picture & About Me
- Enable users to upload a profile picture and provide a text box for an "About Me" section.

### Visual Resume Upload
- Implement a system where users can upload a visual resume in a viewable format, such as a PDF or a dynamic web page.

## 2. Streamer Side

### Profile Browsing
- Create a search and filter system for streamers to browse moderator profiles based on criteria like platform, experience, etc.

### Profile Viewing
- Allow streamers to view detailed profiles and resumes without needing to download files.

### Messaging System
- Implement a messaging feature for streamers to communicate directly with potential moderators.

## 3. Backend Development

### Database
- Use a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store user profiles, messages, and other data.

### File Storage
- Utilize cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) for storing profile pictures and resumes.

### Messaging System
- Implement real-time messaging using WebSockets or a service like Firebase.

## 4. Frontend Development

### Profile Interface
- Design a user-friendly interface for creating and viewing profiles using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a framework like React).

### Responsive Design
- Ensure the website is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Messaging UI
- Build a clean and intuitive messaging interface, possibly with real-time updates.

## 5. Additional Features

### Search and Filter Options
- Implement advanced search with filters like platform, experience, availability, etc.

### Notification System
- Notify users (moderators and streamers) of new messages or profile views.

## 6. Security

### Data Protection
- Ensure secure data handling and storage, especially for sensitive information.

### User Authentication
- Implement secure login mechanisms and consider adding two-factor authentication (2FA).

## 7. Deployment

### Hosting
- Deploy the website on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

### Domain & SSL
- Purchase a domain name and ensure SSL certification for secure access.
